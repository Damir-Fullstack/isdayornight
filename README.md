# Another Project
Hello everybody there👋 
**WARNING⚠️:**
*This project doesn't show a day or night in reel time⏰.*
---
# ❓How works❓
When you click button "change", the background from blue background 🔵(it's a day) to black background ⚫(night). When you click button "Day or Night", process of checking it's "day☀️" or "night🌙" is working and in div, you can see it's "day" or "night".
Almost all project works on language of coding: 
**JavaScript**.
Yup it's really. You also can check it.
**❓How❓**
All code on **JavaScript** is in file *script.js*.
All functional part of project is **HTML+JavaScript**. For example:
1️⃣Text after we can see after click a button "Day or Night" is <div> and code in JavaScript.
2️⃣All buttons is <button> and code.
             **‼️BUT:‼️**
Blue🔵 or black⚫ background is **CSS+JavaScript**, because in first colour is blue🔵(HEX #0000ff) and when you click button then changes to black⚫(HEX #000000)
